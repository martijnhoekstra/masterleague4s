# Contributing

## Thank you for considering contributing to this project!

Before a 1.0 release is ready, things should be understood to be in constant flux. What seems like a good idea today may
not work out tomorrow, be ripped out, only to be re-introduced later in some other form, or forgotten in time and left to decay.

As such, structural work and bug fixes before 1.0 are difficult.

That doesn't mean there is nothing to do for someone coming to the project. In the issue list, you may occationally see a
"help wanted" issue. Those issues are deemed to be particularly suited for new contributors.

Filing issues is a another great way to help shape the library, and find out what works for you, and what works for the project.
